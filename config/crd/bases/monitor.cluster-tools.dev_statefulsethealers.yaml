              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  FailureTimeThreshold is the duration a pod can stay unhealthy
                  (e.g. NotReady or CrashLoopBackOff) before being restarted.
                  Duration should be in the format "30s", "5m", "1h".

                  MaxRestartAttempts defines how many times a pod can be restarted

                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.
